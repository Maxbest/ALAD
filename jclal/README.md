JCLAL framework is open source software and it is distributed under the GNU general public license. It is constructed with a high-level software environment, with a strong object oriented design and use of design patterns, which allow to the developers reuse, modify and extend the framework. Up to date, JCLAL uses the WEKA (http://weka.sourceforge.net) and MULAN (http://mulan.sourceforge.net) libraries to implement the most significant query strategies that have appeared on the single-label and multi-label learning paradigms. For next versions, we hope to include query strategies related with multi-instance and multi-label-multi-instance learning paradigms.
